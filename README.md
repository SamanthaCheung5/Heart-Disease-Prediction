# Heart Disease Predictor
## Overview
The Heart Disease Predictor is a supervised machine learning model developed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical and demographic factors. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention efforts by providing accurate predictions of heart disease risk.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilized a Heart Disease dataset from UCI's Machine Learning Repository containing information on patient medical information and diagnostic test results. 
- **Model Development**: Implemented and evaluated two supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors to build the best predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Employed cross-validation techniques and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's predictive performance.
- **User Interface**: Developed a user-friendly interface allowing users to input their medical information and obtain personalized predicitions of heart disease.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Heart Disease Predictor,
1.  Clone the repository to your local machine
2.  chmod +x code.py to give executable permissions
3.  Run the script which will generate bar chart showing the performance of the two ML models
4.  Close the bar chart and input user specific data
5.  Obtain a personalized predicition of heart disease
